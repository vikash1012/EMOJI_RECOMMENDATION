Friend who had big addiction issues, ended up being completely isolated, skipped school, and had a very low self esteem. I convinced him to go see a doc together, and promised him that i would go through everything with him. He went to rehab for a few months and now he's clean. But the complete lack of support from his family, from school, changed him. I think it was too late when I helped him (he was like that for 5 months) and he'll never be the same as before.. \n",
